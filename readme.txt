Looking for some help to get this running. The lcd im using is the 7" Capacitive touch from BuyDisplay

http://www.buydisplay.com/default/7-inch-lcd-module-capacitive-touch-screen-panel-i2c-spi-serial

Datasheet on their site

The schematic (simple test pcb) is in the sch folder.

The LCD doesnt seem to like 8bit mode ... all jumpers are set from factory... (double checked by me) including all resistors.

Pinouts double checked. (probably 4+ times)

So it has to be a code issue. Please if you see anything help me out... im going crazy here!
